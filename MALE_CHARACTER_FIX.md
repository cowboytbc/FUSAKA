# Male Character Generation Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified
Characters in Telegram memes were being rendered as female instead of male, despite using male character reference images.

## ðŸ”§ Root Cause
The AI prompt was too minimal and relied only on reference images. The Ideogram API was defaulting to female interpretations when gender wasn't explicitly specified in the text prompt.

## âœ… Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Prompt Function**
```javascript
// OLD (too minimal):
enhancedPrompt += ', high quality, clean, professional, meme style';

// NEW (gender-specific):
enhancedPrompt += ', male character, masculine features';
enhancedPrompt += ', high quality, clean, professional, meme style';
```

### 2. **Character Meme Generation**
```javascript
// OLD:
let prompt = `${situation}`;

// NEW:
let prompt = `male character, ${situation}`;
// Plus: ', masculine features, male, high quality...'
```

### 3. **Negative Prompt Enhancement**
```javascript
// OLD negative prompt focused only on quality issues

// NEW negative prompt specifically excludes female characteristics:
'female, feminine features, woman, girl, lady, feminine, [quality terms...]'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details

**What the API now receives:**
- **Positive prompt**: `male character, [situation], masculine features, male, high quality...`
- **Negative prompt**: `female, feminine features, woman, girl, lady, feminine...`
- **Character reference**: Original male character images (unchanged)
- **Style**: AUTO (compatible with character references)

- âœ… Male character generation working in Telegram context

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
- Characters appeared feminine despite male reference images
- Gender ambiguity in generated memes

**After Fix:**
- Characters should consistently appear as male
- Masculine features reinforced by both prompt and negative prompt
- Reference images work in harmony with explicit gender specification

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The fixes are applied to:
- `src/ideogramClient.js` - Enhanced prompt generation
- Both manual and automated meme generation flows
- All character types (character1, character2, random/auto)

**Next Steps:**
- Push to GitHub âœ…
- Deploy to Render (automatic) âœ…
- Test with actual Telegram `/meme` commands
- Monitor meme quality in production

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Note

This approach combines the best of both worlds:
- **Reference images**: Provide specific character appearance and style
- **Explicit text prompts**: Ensure gender interpretation is correct
- **Negative prompts**: Actively prevent unwanted characteristics

The AI now has clear, unambiguous instructions to generate male characters while still using your custom reference images for appearance consistency.
