# 🚨 CRITICAL API OPTIMIZATION - EMERGENCY FIXES APPLIED

## **CRISIS DETECTED:** API Rate Limit Abuse 

**⚠️ ISSUE**: Bot was burning through Twitter API limits too aggressively:
- 441 API reads in one day (approaching 3333 daily limit)  
- Rate limiting (429 errors) hitting multiple influencers
- Daily influencer limits reached too early
- Zero mentions detected due to over-aggressive API usage

## 🛠️ **EMERGENCY OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED**

### **1. 📉 API FREQUENCY REDUCTION**
```diff
- Mention checking: Every 5 minutes (288 checks/day)
+ Mention checking: Every 15 minutes (96 checks/day)

- Influencer monitoring: Every 30 minutes (48 cycles/day)  
+ Influencer monitoring: Every 60 minutes (24 cycles/day)
```
**API REDUCTION**: ~67% fewer API calls per day

### **2. 🔥 SEARCH API REMOVAL**  
```diff
- Dual detection: Timeline + Search API (2 calls per mention check)
+ Timeline only: Single API call per mention check
```
**RESULT**: 50% reduction in mention checking API usage

### **3. 📊 RESULT LIMIT OPTIMIZATION**
```diff
- Mention results: 100 per check
+ Mention results: 25 per check

- Influencers per cycle: 10 
+ Influencers per cycle: 6

- Processing delay: 2 seconds between influencers
+ Processing delay: 4 seconds between influencers  
```

### **4. 🎯 DAILY LIMIT REBALANCING**
```diff
- Vitalik daily limit: 3 replies
+ Vitalik daily limit: 5 replies

- Ethereum daily limit: 2 replies  
+ Ethereum daily limit: 4 replies
```
**STRATEGY**: Higher limits spread throughout longer intervals
